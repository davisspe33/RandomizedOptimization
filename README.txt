Code can be found here: https://github.com/davisspe33/RandomizedOptimization

This is a Python3 Project 

Download Python3 and pip3 

To install all dependancies run the following command from the root of this directory
    - 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt'

To run the algortithms on one of the different problems:
    -  'cd part1-RandomizedOptimazationAlgos/'
    -  'python3 `selectedProblem`.py'
    - where selectedProblem is the problem you want to run

To run the algortithms on the BreastCancer data with the neural net run the follwoing command
    - 'cd part2-ann/'
    - 'python3 `selectedAlgo`-ann.py'
    - where selectedAlgo is the algorithm you want to run with the neural nets

The datasets used in this project can be found in the csv in the part2-ann directory.
